			<h1>A Guide for the Traveling Dog</h1>
			<p>It is surprising how differently people around the world interpret the vocalizations of dogs. This prompted me to create a map of the world depicting these differences. The placement and size of each interpretation is based on the location and population of the country. China, which is home to the largest population (1,351,290,000) in the world, is depicted with a 1250pt font size. On the other side of the spectrum, Mozambique, home to the smallest population, is depicted with a 19pt font size. When the cursor hovers over an orange circle, the name of the country is shown. If the same circle is clicked, a person mimicking the vocalization of dogs in the personâ€™s native language is heard. The font color also informs the user of the population of pet dogs in that country, as darker shades of blue represent a larger number.
