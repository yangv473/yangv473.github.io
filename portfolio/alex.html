			<h1>Alex</h1>
			<p><q>Playing a video game, you feel engaged, stimulated, kids with ADD don&#39;t get that when they are sitting in school or reading a book.</q> <br>-Timothy Fong, MD.
			<br><br>6.4 million children ages 4 to 17 have received an ADHD diagnosis. This inspired me to create Alex, a mobile application featuring easy-to-play games that help children learn to think ahead, deal with failure, solve problems, and make friends. For example, kids with ADHD often cross streets without giving enough thought. One of the games in this app involves using their finger to keep all the characters from entering the streets. I believe this repetitive swiping motion will inadvertently help the children to realize that the streets can be dangerous and therefore require attention before crossing. When starting Alex, the kids complete a short quiz that ends with the gifting of their personal Alex who becomes their character. Also, I envisioned the creation of Alex dolls that have a pocket where their mouth should be. The phone would go in the pocket and talk to the kids just as a friend would. In ways like this, I hope to improve the lives of kids with ADHD in a fun and interactive way.
